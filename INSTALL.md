Install by running the ./build.bash command:

./build.bash
Need to install the following packages:
  quorum-genesis-tool@0.2.3
Ok to proceed? (y) y
Creating bootnodes...
Creating members...
Creating validators...
Artifacts in folder: ./output/2022-10-17-22-09-01

This will build one node. It will be in the Node-0 directory
unless you pass it another node number as a parameter.

If you are joining an existing Quorum, you will need to communicate the following information:

new-static-nodes.json

(Note, the static-nodes.json file on github is just an example. You need the real static-nodes.json file from the project.


Next you will need to run the start script, which you might need to change.
